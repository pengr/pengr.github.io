Hi, I'm Ru Peng (prounced /roo puhng/, English name Perry), a PhD student at the [DiLab](https://dilab-zju.github.io), Department of Computer Science, [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by Professors [Junbo Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8ipao8MAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Gang Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0098112).
I was a research intern at [Alibaba Qwen Team](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/qianwen/), working with [Dayiheng Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pPLQrX4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Chang Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QeSoG3sAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Jingren Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=64zxhRUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 
Previously, l was fortunate to collaborate with Professors [Tianyong Hao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gM77jOQAAAAJ&hl=en), [Yi Fang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BKTLYwQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Kehai Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_M4Am0AAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

My research interests spread across **LLMs (current emphasis)**, machine learning, NLP and multimodal - toward building Jarvis-esque AGl to change human living.
**I am open to both academic and industry opportunities.** Feel free to reach out!

<!-- ### <span style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-weight: bold;">ðŸ¦„ Research Interest</span>

<small><em>"Seek truth and beauty."</em></small>

My research vision is to understand the fundamental mechanisms underpinning the practical success of deep learning, including (M)LLMs, and to develop a theoretically grounded, incentivized, democratic, and scalable decentralized learning framework as a foundation for next-generation general intelligence.
Currently, my research lies at the intersection of these two directions:

- **Decentralized learning** (e.g., [generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12680), [training dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02913), [data influence](https://openreview.net/forum?id=2TIYkqieKw), [communication allocation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lWGMbJRCtQ), [benchmarking](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hDfD4HcDo0));
- **Science of deep learning** (e.g., [symmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09189), [training dynamics/implicit bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02913), [emergence of mergeability](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lWGMbJRCtQ)); -->
